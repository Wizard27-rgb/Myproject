# 🔐 PassVault — Secure Password Manager

*A lightweight encrypted password storage system*

## 📌 What This Project Is

PassVault is a simple and secure **local password manager** built using C++ (or your language—let me know and I’ll modify it).
It allows users to:

* Store passwords safely
* Retrieve saved credentials
* Add new website/app entries
* View stored data securely
* Update or delete password records

It is designed to be lightweight, offline, and secure for personal use.

# 🔒 Why This Project Is Needed

Today, people use dozens of online platforms that require strong and unique passwords.
But most users still:

* Reuse the same weak password
* Forget passwords frequently
* Store them in unsafe places like notes or screenshots
* Are vulnerable to social engineering attacks

PassVault solves these problems by offering a simple and secure way to store passwords locally.

#  How PassVault Ensures Security

PassVault enhances digital security through:

### 1. Local Encryption

Passwords are not stored in plain text.
They are encrypted before being saved, preventing unauthorized access.

### 2. Master Key Authentication

Only the user with the correct **master password / PIN** can unlock the vault.

### 3. No Internet Requirement

The program works offline, reducing the risk of online attacks.

### 4. Structured Storage

Data is stored in a secure structured file (e.g., encrypted `.txt`, `.dat`, or JSON—whatever your program uses).

# How PassVault Promotes Sustainability (If required for report)

Even though PassVault is a software project, it supports sustainability by:

### 1. Reducing the Need for Physical Storage

No need for printed notes or diaries to store passwords.

### 2. Encouraging Digital Safety

Individuals with secure accounts are less likely to lose data, reducing digital waste and cybercrime.

### 3. Supporting Efficient Resource Use

It is lightweight, runs on low-power systems, and requires minimal memory/CPU resources.
